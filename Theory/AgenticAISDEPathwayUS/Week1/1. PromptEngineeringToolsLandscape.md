---

## 🧬 8. Prompt Tuning / Soft Prompts

**Examples:** HuggingFace, Cohere, OpenAI fine-tuning, LangChain  
**Traits:** Trainable embeddings as prompts; model-internal techniques.  
**Use Case:** Personalized or domain-adapted performance tuning.

---

## 🔀 Diagonal Trend

The diagonal line reflects the natural evolution:  
From static templates → contextual chaining → retrieval-augmented workflows → agents and fine-tuning.

---

## 🧱 Level 1: Static Prompts

### ✅ What They Are

Static prompts are manually written, hardcoded input strings passed to an LLM (e.g., GPT-4) without any dynamic elements.  
These prompts do not change based on user context, data, or previous interactions.

---

### 🧠 Core Idea

> "The prompt is the program."

In static prompts, you write the complete instruction or input exactly as it should be passed to the model.  
There is no logic, templating, or retrieval—just plain text.

---

### 🔧 Examples

#### 🧾 Example 1: Instruction

```plaintext
Explain the difference between supervised and unsupervised learning.
```

#### 🎭 Example 2: Role-playing

```plaintext
You are a Shakespearean playwright. Describe modern-day AI as a soliloquy.
```

#### 🎨 Example 3: Style Transfer

```plaintext
Rewrite the following sentence in the style of Ernest Hemingway:  
"I saw the city lights flicker as we crossed the bridge."
```

### 🧰 Common Use Cases

| Use Case               | Prompt Example                                                                 |
|------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Summarization          | "Summarize this paragraph in one sentence: [text]"                             |
| Translation            | "Translate the following sentence to French: [text]"                           |
| Q&A                    | "What is the capital of France?"                                               |
| Sentiment Analysis     | "What is the sentiment of the following review? Positive, Negative, or Neutral"|
| Role-based Instructions| "You are an expert doctor. Give a diagnosis based on the symptoms."           |

---

### 💡 Best Practices

#### ✅ Be explicit: Avoid ambiguity  
LLMs respond best to **clear and specific instructions**.

Good Prompt:

```plaintext
Summarize this in one sentence.
```

Bad Prompt:

```plaintext
Make it shorter.
```

#### 🔁 Give examples (Few-shot prompting)

```plaintext
Q: What is 5 + 5?  
A: 10  
Q: What is 7 + 2?  
A: 9  
Q: What is 6 + 6?  
A:
```

#### 📐 Specify output format

```plaintext
Extract the following in JSON:  
{ "name": "", "email": "", "phone": "" }  
Text: John Doe, Email: john@example.com, Contact: 123-456-7890
```

### ⚠️ Limitations

- ❌ **No adaptability:** Works poorly if input changes  
- ❌ **Not reusable:** You must manually change text for each use  
- ❌ **No memory/context:** Can’t incorporate chat history or user-specific data  
- ❌ **No chaining:** Cannot support multi-step workflows or tasks  

---

### 🧪 Tools Supporting Static Prompts

While many tools support more advanced workflows, static prompts are often used in:

- **ChatGPT / Claude / Gemini interfaces**
- **OpenAI Playground**
- **Basic API calls** like:

```python
response = openai.ChatCompletion.create(
    model="gpt-4",
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Explain black holes like I'm 5"}]
)
```

### 🧭 When to Use

| Situation                            | Should Use? |
|-------------------------------------|-------------|
| Just trying out ideas quickly       | ✅ Yes      |
| Internal dev experiments            | ✅ Yes      |
| User-specific context required      | ❌ No       |
| Reusable components or workflows    | ❌ No       |
| Multi-turn conversations            | ❌ No       |

---

### 🧗 From Here to Next Level

If static prompts feel limiting, the natural next step is **Prompt Templates – Level 2** —  where you inject variables into predefined structures, allowing **some flexibility and reusability**.

---

## 🧩 Level 2: Prompt Templates

### ✅ What They Are

Prompt templates introduce parameterization to static prompts. Rather than hardcoding every input, you define a reusable prompt with placeholders (variables), which can be filled dynamically at runtime.

> “Prompt templates let you reuse prompt logic across different inputs or tasks.”

---

### 🔧 Structure

A prompt template includes:

- **Fixed parts:** Instruction or context that remains constant  
- **Variable parts:** Placeholders like `{user_input}`, `{name}`, `{topic}`, etc.

---

### 📦 Examples

#### 🧾 Basic Template

```plaintext
"Summarize the following in one sentence: {text}"
```

With input:

```json
{ "text": "Machine learning is a field of computer science that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed." }
```

Final prompt:

```plaintext
Summarize the following in one sentence: Machine learning is a field of computer science that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed.
```

#### 🧑‍⚕️ Role-Based Example:

```plaintext
You are a doctor. Based on the symptoms below, provide a diagnosis and next steps.
Symptoms: {symptoms}
```

#### 🛠️ With LangChain (Python):
```python
from langchain.prompts import PromptTemplate

template = PromptTemplate.from_template(
    "Translate the following to {language}: {sentence}"
)
filled_prompt = template.format(language="French", sentence="Hello, how are you?")
```

| 📤 Email reply drafts | "Write a polite response to: {email_text}"               |
| 🌐 SEO Blog assistant | "Write a blog post on '{topic}' for a tech-savvy audience." |

---

### 🔥 Best Practices:

**Use Descriptive Variables**:
- ✅ `{job_description}`, `{candidate_resume}`
- ❌ `{input1}`, `{input2}`

**Validate Input Before Filling**:
- Check nulls, character limits, formatting

**Use `format()` or LangChain-style templating safely**:
- Avoid injection issues or malformed prompts

**Version Your Templates**:
- Keep track of changes over time in a structured repo

---

### ⚙️ Tools & Libraries:

| Tool                | Usage                           |
|---------------------|----------------------------------|
| **LangChain**       | Built-in `PromptTemplate` class |
| **PromptLayer**     | Prompt analytics and logging     |
| **PromptOps, Vellum** | Visual template builders       |
| **Jinja2 (Python)** | Generic templating engine        |
| **Mustache, Handlebars** | Web template standards     |

---

### 🔒 Limitations:

- Still doesn’t understand **user context** or chat history
- No **conditionals** or logic (e.g., "if the language is French, do X")
- No **memory** or tool use
- No **chaining** — a single prompt at a time

---

### 🧗 What’s Next:

To go beyond static templates, you'll want **Prompt Composition (Level 3)** — where templates can be assembled, parameterized, and used dynamically in branching logic or workflows.

#### [How Microsoft defends against indirect prompt injection attacks](https://msrc.microsoft.com/blog/2025/07/how-microsoft-defends-against-indirect-prompt-injection-attacks/)

---

## 🏗️ Level 3: Prompt Composition

### 🧩 What They Are

Prompt composition is about combining multiple prompt templates into larger, modular systems.  
Instead of one giant prompt, you break it into smaller pieces (modules) and assemble them into workflows.  

"Prompt composition = modular building blocks of prompts."

This makes prompts reusable, testable, and maintainable, much like functions in programming.  

---

### 🧠 Core Idea

"Compose small, reusable prompts into bigger workflows."  

Just as software engineers don’t hardcode everything in one function, prompt engineers modularize instructions and connect them to form a pipeline.  

---

### 🔧 Examples

#### 🧾 Example 1: Modular QA System

```
[Prompt 1: Rewriter]
Rewrite the user question to make it precise and unambiguous: {question}

[Prompt 2: Knowledge Query]
Based on the rewritten question, search the knowledge base for relevant content.

[Prompt 3: Answer Generator]
Using the knowledge content: {retrieved_text}, answer the user’s question clearly.
```

---

#### 📝 Example 2: Role Split Composition

```plaintext
[Prompt A: Critic]
Evaluate the clarity and tone of this draft: {draft}

[Prompt B: Improver]
Rewrite the draft in a clearer and friendlier way, considering Critic’s feedback: {critic_feedback}
```

---

#### 🛠️ Example 3: With LangChain (Python)

```python
from langchain.prompts import PromptTemplate
from langchain.chains import SequentialChain, LLMChain

rewrite_template = PromptTemplate.from_template("Rewrite this question: {question}")
rewrite_chain = LLMChain(llm=llm, prompt=rewrite_template, output_key="rewritten")

search_template = PromptTemplate.from_template("Find relevant knowledge for: {rewritten}")
search_chain = LLMChain(llm=llm, prompt=search_template, output_key="knowledge")

answer_template = PromptTemplate.from_template(
    "Answer the question '{rewritten}' using: {knowledge}"
)
answer_chain = LLMChain(llm=llm, prompt=answer_template, output_key="answer")

pipeline = SequentialChain(
    chains=[rewrite_chain, search_chain, answer_chain],
    input_variables=["question"],
    output_variables=["answer"]
)
```

---

### 🧰 Common Use Cases

| Use Case                    | Composition Example                         |
|-----------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| Multi-step QA               | Rewrite → Retrieve → Answer                 |
| Content generation pipeline | Outline → Expand sections → Proofread → Format |
| Code generation             | Describe → Generate code → Write tests → Review |
| Multi-role feedback loops   | Author → Critic → Editor                     |
| Structured reasoning        | Break problem → Solve subproblems → Merge answers |

---

### 💡 Benefits

| Feature       | Benefit                                               |
|---------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| Modularity    | Easier to debug, reuse, and maintain prompts          |
| Reusability   | Prompts can be shared across pipelines                |
| Transparency  | Each step is interpretable (vs. giant monolithic one) |
| Composability | Works well with logic/branching (if/else, retries)    |

---

### 🔥 Best Practices

- Keep prompts small and focused  
  One prompt = one role/task. Avoid “do everything” prompts.  

- Name your modules clearly  
  Example: `QuestionRewriter`, `ContentSummarizer` — not `Prompt1`, `Prompt2`.  

- Test submodules independently  
  Debug each step before combining them.  

- Add guardrails between steps  
  Validate outputs (format, length, JSON validity) before passing forward.  

- Log intermediate results  
  Helps with observability and error tracing.

### ⚙️ Tools and Libraries

| Tool                  | Usage                                          |
|-----------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| LangChain             | SequentialChain, RouterChain, map-reduce flows |
| PromptOps             | Composition and version control of prompts     |
| Returne / Promptable  | Modular pipelines                              |
| ChainForge            | Visual prompt chaining experiments             |
| Jinja2 + Custom Code  | Lightweight manual composition                 |

---

### 🔒 Limitations

- Still lacks contextual memory (doesn’t remember across sessions unless managed manually).  
- Can become brittle if one module produces unexpected output.  
- Complexity grows fast — pipelines can become hard to manage without tooling.  
- Not autonomous — still requires human-defined flow.  

---

### 🧭 When to Use

| Situation                        | Should Use? |
|---------------------------------|--------------|
| Building reusable NLP pipelines | Yes          |
| Multi-step reasoning workflows  | Yes          |
| Context-rich assistants         | No           |
| Long-running conversations      | No           |

---

### 🧗 From Here to Next Level

Once you’re composing prompts into pipelines, the next step is Contextual Prompts (Level 4) — where prompts dynamically adapt based on chat history, documents, or external signals.

---

## 🧠 Level 4: Contextual Prompts

### ✅ What They Are

Contextual prompts are **dynamic prompts that incorporate additional context** — such as chat history, documents, user data, or environmental variables — to make responses more relevant and coherent.  

Instead of giving the LLM a single isolated input, contextual prompting **enriches the input with surrounding information**, enabling continuity, personalization, and grounding.

---

### 🧠 Core Idea

> “A prompt is only as good as the context you feed it.”  

By feeding **conversation history, retrieved documents, or structured metadata** into the LLM prompt, you create a system that adapts to the situation rather than treating each input independently.

---

### 🔧 Examples

#### 🧾 Example 1: Chat History

```plaintext
[History]
User: What's the weather in Bangalore today?
Assistant: It's 28°C and sunny.

[New Prompt]
User: And tomorrow?
```

➡️ The assistant understands “tomorrow” by carrying forward the context of Bangalore weather.

#### 📚 Example 2: Knowledge-Grounded Q&A  
```plaintext
[Context from Docs]  
"OpenAI was founded in December 2015 by Elon Musk, Sam Altman, and others."  

[User Input]  
Who founded OpenAI?  
```

➡️ The LLM grounds its answer in retrieved contextual documents rather than hallucinating.  

#### 🧑‍💻 Example 3: Personalization  
```plaintext
[User Profile]  
Name: Alice  
Preferred Language: Spanish  

[Prompt]  
Greet the user politely. 
``` 

➡️ Output: “Hola Alice, ¡encantado de verte de nuevo!”  

#### 🛠️ Example 4: With LangChain (Python)
```python
from langchain.prompts import ChatPromptTemplate

template = ChatPromptTemplate.from_messages([
    ("system", "You are a helpful assistant."),
    ("human", "{user_input}"),
    ("ai", "Previous response: {chat_history}")
])

filled_prompt = template.format_messages(
    user_input="What’s the capital of France?",
    chat_history="Earlier we talked about European cities."
)
```

### 🧰 Common Use Cases  
| Use Case              | Contextual Element Used                         |
|------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| Chatbots / Assistants  | Conversation history                           |
| RAG (chat with docs)   | Retrieved text chunks from vector DBs (Pinecone, Weaviate) |
| Personalization        | User profile (preferences, role, language)     |
| Enterprise Apps        | Business rules, CRM data, logs                 |
| Multimodal Input       | Images, metadata, or sensor data included in the prompt |

### 💡 Benefits  
| Benefit         | Why It Matters                                   |
|-----------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| 🧠 Relevance    | Answers tailored to current conversation or data |
| 🔁 Continuity   | Multi-turn conversations feel natural            |
| 📚 Groundedness | Reduces hallucinations by retrieving facts       |
| 🧑‍🎨 Personalization | Adapts answers to individual users         |
| ⚙️ Better workflows | Forms the base for RAG & chaining          |

### 🔥 Best Practices  
- **Structure Your Context Clearly**  
  Use separators like [History], [Docs], [Profile]  
  Avoid dumping raw unstructured text  

- **Control Context Length**  
  Use summarization or windowing for long histories  
  Otherwise you risk token overflow  

- **Retrieve Relevant Data Only**  
  Use embeddings + vector search to pick top-k documents  
  Don’t overwhelm the model with irrelevant noise  

- **Protect Against Injection**  
  Validate retrieved content (see Microsoft on indirect prompt injection)  

### ⚠️ Limitations  
- ❌ Token limits — large histories or docs may exceed model capacity  
- ❌ Noise sensitivity — irrelevant context can confuse model  
- ❌ No reasoning logic — just adds context, doesn’t chain multiple steps  
- ❌ Security risks — prompt injection if untrusted external content is inserted  

### 🧪 Tools Supporting Contextual Prompts  
- Vellum – context-aware prompt management  
- Drafter – integrates user/system context in workflows  
- HumanFirst – conversational design with context  
- LangChain – ConversationBuffer, ConversationSummary, ConversationKG memory modules  
- LlamaIndex – context injection via retrievers  

### 🧭 When to Use  
| Situation                           | Should Use? |
|-------------------------------------|-------------|
| Simple one-off Q&A                   | ❌ No        |
| Multi-turn chatbots                  | ✅ Yes       |
| Knowledge-grounded assistants        | ✅ Yes       |
| Personalized AI experiences          | ✅ Yes       |
| Long reasoning pipelines w/ multiple steps | ❌ Not alone (use chaining/RAG) |

### 🧗 From Here to Next Level  
Contextual prompts unlock memory and personalization, but they’re still not enough for workflows or reasoning.  

➡️ The natural next step is **Prompt Chaining – Level 5**, where outputs of one prompt feed into the next to build multi-step reasoning pipelines.  

---

## 🔗 Level 5: Prompt Chaining

### ✅ What They Are

Prompt chaining is the process of **connecting multiple LLM calls together**, where the **output of one prompt becomes the input to the next**.  
This enables the creation of **multi-step workflows** and **complex reasoning pipelines** that go beyond what a single prompt can achieve.

---

### 🧠 Core Idea

> “Break a big task into smaller LLM-powered steps.”  

Instead of cramming everything into one giant prompt, prompt chaining decomposes problems into **manageable subtasks** and stitches them together logically.

---

### 🔧 Examples

#### 🧾 Example 1: Question → Research → Answer

```plaintext
Step 1: Generate search queries
User: “Explain the impact of climate change on agriculture in India.”

Step 2: Retrieve relevant documents

Step 3: Summarize into final answer
```
➡️ Each step is handled by a separate LLM call, forming a pipeline.

#### 📚 Example 2: Text → Analysis → Action

```plaintext
[Prompt 1]
Extract key entities from the following email: {email_text}

[Prompt 2]
Classify intent (support request, sales, spam) based on entities: {entities}

[Prompt 3]
Generate an appropriate response template for intent: {intent}
```

#### 🛠️ Example 3: With LangChain (Python)

```python
from langchain.prompts import PromptTemplate
from langchain.chains import LLMChain, SequentialChain
from langchain.llms import OpenAI

llm = OpenAI(model="gpt-4")

# Step 1: Summarization
summarize_template = PromptTemplate.from_template("Summarize this text: {input_text}")
summarize_chain = LLMChain(llm=llm, prompt=summarize_template, output_key="summary")

# Step 2: Sentiment Analysis
sentiment_template = PromptTemplate.from_template("What is the sentiment of this summary: {summary}")
sentiment_chain = LLMChain(llm=llm, prompt=sentiment_template, output_key="sentiment")

# Sequential Chain
overall_chain = SequentialChain(
    chains=[summarize_chain, sentiment_chain],
    input_variables=["input_text"],
    output_variables=["summary", "sentiment"]
)

result = overall_chain.run({"input_text": "The product was great but the delivery was late."})
print(result)
```

### 🧰 Common Use Cases  
| Use Case                  | How Chaining Helps                                           |
|----------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| Multi-step reasoning       | Break down logical steps across multiple prompts            |
| Data extraction pipelines  | Extract → Transform → Summarize                              |
| Conversational flows       | Capture user input → interpret → generate response          |
| Workflow automation        | Use LLMs as glue between APIs, databases, and tools         |
| RAG + reasoning            | Retrieve documents → analyze → produce final grounded answer|

### 💡 Benefits  
| Benefit                  | Why It Matters                                              |
|--------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| 🧩 Modularization        | Easier debugging & improvements step by step               |
| 🔁 Reusability           | Chains can be reused as building blocks                     |
| 🧠 Decomposition         | Handles complex tasks better than one-shot prompting       |
| ⚙️ Workflow integration   | Connects LLM outputs with external tools                   |
| 📈 Scalability           | Forms the backbone of larger agentic systems               |

### 🔥 Best Practices  
- **Keep Each Step Focused**  
  Each chain should have a single responsibility.  

- **Validate Outputs Between Steps**  
  Check format, correctness, and guard against hallucinations.  

- **Use Structured Outputs**  
  Prefer JSON or key-value outputs for passing between steps.  

- **Add Error Handling & Fallbacks**  
  Retry or rephrase prompts if a step fails.  

- **Monitor Latency & Costs**  
  More steps = more API calls = higher cost + slower responses.  

⚠️ Limitations  
- ❌ Latency — multiple LLM calls slow down workflows  
- ❌ Error propagation — mistake in early step cascades downstream  
- ❌ Token budget — passing large context between steps can explode cost  
- ❌ Not autonomous — requires explicit chaining, no self-directed planning

🧗 From Here to Next Level  
Prompt chaining is the bridge from simple contextual prompts to full orchestration and reasoning systems.  

➡️ The next natural step is **RAG / Prompt Pipelines – Level 6**, where LLMs are combined with vector search, external knowledge bases, and orchestration frameworks for truly knowledge-grounded workflows.

---

## 📚 Level 6: RAG / Prompt Pipelines

### ✅ What They Are

RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) combines **LLMs with external knowledge sources**.  
Instead of relying solely on the model's pre-trained knowledge, RAG **retrieves relevant documents** from vector stores or databases and injects them into the prompt dynamically.  

Prompt pipelines extend this by **orchestrating multiple LLM calls** with retrieval, transformation, and post-processing.

---

### 🧠 Core Idea

> “Let the model read before it answers.”  

By connecting **retrievers (vector search, embeddings, keyword search) with generators (LLMs)**, you can answer questions accurately even about **new or niche information** outside the model’s training data.

---

### 🔧 Examples

#### 🧾 Example 1: Company Policy Assistant

```plaintext
User: What is our leave policy for remote employees?

[Retriever fetches relevant HR doc: Section 4.3]

System Prompt:
Based on the document excerpt below, answer the user query:
---
"Section 4.3: Remote employees are entitled to 12 days leave per year..."
---

Answer: According to the HR document, remote employees get 12 leave days annually.
```

#### 📚 Example 2: Research QA with Multiple Sources

```plaintext
User: Explain the environmental impact of electric vehicles in India.

[Retriever finds three papers: emissions, battery lifecycle, electricity mix]

System aggregates and summarizes into coherent response, citing sources.
```

#### 🛠️ Example 3: LangChain RAG Pipeline (Python)

```python
from langchain.chains import RetrievalQA
from langchain.vectorstores import FAISS
from langchain.embeddings.openai import OpenAIEmbeddings
from langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAI

# Load vector store
embeddings = OpenAIEmbeddings()
vectorstore = FAISS.load_local("india_env_docs", embeddings)

retriever = vectorstore.as_retriever()
qa_chain = RetrievalQA.from_chain_type(
    llm=ChatOpenAI(model="gpt-4"),
    retriever=retriever,
    chain_type="stuff"  # Options: stuff, map_reduce, refine
)

result = qa_chain.run("Explain the environmental impact of electric vehicles in India.")
print(result)
```

### 🧗 From Here to Next Level  
RAG and prompt pipelines enable knowledge-grounded, multi-step workflows.  

➡️ The next natural step is **Autonomous Agents – Level 7**, where LLMs not only retrieve and generate, but plan, act, and decide independently using tools, memory, and reasoning.

---

## 🤖 Level 7: Autonomous Agents

### ✅ What They Are

Autonomous agents are **goal-driven AI systems** that combine LLMs with **planning, memory, and tools** to act independently.  
Unlike static prompts or simple chains, agents can **decide what steps to take, which tools to use, and how to react** based on feedback from their environment.

---

### 🧠 Core Idea

> “Give the model a mission, not a single question.”  

Agents break down complex tasks, plan sequences of actions, and execute them with or without human intervention. They are **self-directed orchestrators of LLM-powered workflows**.

Key components of an agent:

1. **Planner** – Decides which actions to take.  
2. **Executor / Tools** – APIs, scripts, search engines, calculators, etc.  
3. **Memory** – Stores previous observations, actions, and results.  
4. **LLM** – Provides reasoning, decision-making, and natural language generation.  

---

### 🔧 Examples

#### 🧾 Example 1: AutoGPT-style Task

```plaintext
Goal: Plan a weekend trip to Bangalore within a $200 budget.

Agent Steps:
1. Search for affordable flights and hotels.
2. Create a daily itinerary based on attractions.
3. Generate a packing list.
4. Summarize and output a plan.

Agent decides step order autonomously, retrieves data, and generates outputs.
```

#### 📚 Example 2: Multi-Tool Research Agent

```plaintext
Goal: Write a report on renewable energy trends.

Agent Steps:
1. Search web for latest articles (WebSearch tool)
2. Summarize each article (LLM)
3. Store key facts in memory
4. Draft report sections (LLM)
5. Combine sections into final report
```

#### 🛠️ Example 3: Python Pseudocode Using LangChain Agent

```python
from langchain.agents import initialize_agent, Tool
from langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAI

# Define tools
tools = [
    Tool(name="Calculator", func=lambda x: eval(x), description="Performs math calculations"),
    Tool(name="WebSearch", func=lambda query: search_web(query), description="Searches the web")
]

# Initialize agent
llm = ChatOpenAI(model="gpt-4")
agent = initialize_agent(tools, llm, agent_type="zero-shot-react-description", verbose=True)

# Run task
task = "Find the top 3 renewable energy companies in India and calculate their average market cap."
agent.run(task)
```

## 🤖 Level 8: Prompt Tuning/ Soft prompting

Large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT are foundation models—large, reusable models trained on vast amounts of knowledge from the internet. These models are highly flexible: the same LLM can analyze legal documents, answer questions, or even write a poem about a soccer team.

But what if we want to improve the performance of pre-trained LLMs for a **specialized task**? Until recently, the standard approach was **fine-tuning**.

### 1. Fine-Tuning

Fine-tuning involves gathering and labeling **large amounts of task-specific data**. The pre-trained model is then trained further on this dataset, allowing it to specialize without starting from scratch.

**Example: Classifying legal documents**

- **Task:** Categorize documents into “Contract,” “Patent,” or “Regulation”  
- **Data:** 10,000 labeled legal documents  
- **Process:** Fine-tune the pre-trained LLM on this dataset  
- **Result:** The model can now classify new documents accurately

**Pros:**  
- High accuracy for specialized tasks  

**Cons:**  
- Requires large labeled datasets  
- Computationally expensive  

### 2. Prompt Engineering (Hard Prompts)

Prompt engineering is the task of designing **human-readable prompts** to guide an LLM to perform a task **without retraining**.

**Example: English-to-French translation**

- **Task description:** “Translate English to French”  
- **Few-shot examples:**  
  ```plaintext
  English: "bread" → French: "pain"
  English: "butter" → French: "beurre"
  ```

- **Input word:** `"cheese"`  
- **Output:** `"fromage"`

Prompt engineering works **at inference time**, allowing specialization using carefully crafted prompts.

**Pros:**  
- No retraining needed  
- Relatively simple  

**Cons:**  
- Handcrafted prompts may require many examples for complex tasks  

### 3. Prompt Tuning (Soft Prompts)

Prompt tuning is a **more scalable and efficient alternative** to fine-tuning or hard prompts. Instead of writing examples in human-readable text, the model is guided by **soft prompts**—learnable embeddings introduced at the model’s input layer.

#### **What’s inside a soft prompt?**

- **Embeddings:** Numerical vectors (arrays of floats) encoding task-specific guidance  
- Each dimension represents a **latent feature**, such as semantic meaning or task bias  

**Analogy: Teaching a human translator**

- **Explicit examples (hard prompts):**  
You show the translator a few word pairs:
```plaintext
bread → pain
butter → beurre
```

Then ask them to translate `"cheese"`—they use the examples to guess the answer.

- **“Feeling” for the task (soft prompts):**  
Instead of giving examples, you give the translator a **subconscious guide**—a sense of “how English maps to French.” They can translate `"cheese"` immediately without seeing explicit examples.

#### **How it works in AI terms**

- The **mental guide** is the **soft prompt embedding**: a vector of numbers  
- Each number encodes a latent feature or pattern learned by the model, for example:
- How English words generally map to French  
- Gender rules in French nouns  
- Common suffix transformations  

- When the model sees **embedding + input**, it “feels” the task context and produces the correct output without explicit examples in text.

### 🔧 How Soft Prompts Are Generated

#### 1️⃣ Initialization
- Start with a sequence of **random floating-point vectors** (e.g., 20–50 vectors).  
- Each vector has the same dimension as the model’s input embeddings (e.g., 768 or 1024).  
- Initially, these vectors are random — they carry no task-specific information.

```plaintext
soft_prompt = [v1, v2, v3, ..., v20]  # each vi = float vector
```

#### 2️⃣ Prepending to Inputs

For every training example, prepend the soft prompt embeddings to the input embeddings:

```plaintext
[soft_prompt_embeddings] + [input_text_embeddings]
```
- This gives the model a task-specific context before reading the actual input.

#### 3️⃣ Training / Optimization

- Provide labeled data for the task (e.g., sentiment, classification, translation).
- Freeze the model weights; only the soft prompt embeddings are trainable.
- Compute the loss between model output and the true label.
- Update the soft prompt embeddings using gradient descent:

```plaintext
soft_prompt = soft_prompt - learning_rate * gradient(loss, soft_prompt)
```

- Iteratively, the embeddings adjust to encode task-specific instructions for the frozen model.

#### 4️⃣ Inference

Prepend the trained soft prompts to new input embeddings.

The model now produces task-specific outputs without full fine-tuning.
