# 🔍 Vector Databases: FAISS vs Pinecone vs Weaviate

Vector databases are essential in **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** pipelines. They store embeddings (text, image, etc.) and allow fast similarity search to retrieve relevant context for LLMs.

This guide compares three popular vector stores: **FAISS**, **Pinecone**, and **Weaviate**.

## 🔌 Tip: LangChain & LlamaIndex Abstract It Away

While using tools like **LangChain** or **LlamaIndex**, you can switch between FAISS, Pinecone, and Weaviate with minimal changes — letting you focus on use case rather than infrastructure.

```python
from langchain.vectorstores import FAISS
faiss_index = FAISS.from_documents(docs, embeddings)
```

# 🧠 Vector Indexing Techniques in Vector Databases

Vector indexing is the process of organizing high-dimensional vectors (like embeddings) to enable fast and scalable similarity search, essential in RAG systems with LLMs.

## 🔍 Search Types

| Type         | Description                              |
|--------------|------------------------------------------|
| Exact Search | Brute-force comparison against all items |
| ANN (Approximate Nearest Neighbor) | Trades a bit of accuracy for massive speed gains |

---

## 🔍 Common Indexing Techniques

### 1. Flat Index (Exact Search)

- **How it works**: Compares the query vector with every stored vector.
- **Speed**: 🔴 Slow
- **Accuracy**: ✅ Perfect

✅ Use When:
- Dataset < 10K vectors
- You need exact recall

```python
index = faiss.IndexFlatL2(dim)
index.add(vectors)
```

---

### 2. IVF (Inverted File Index)

- **How it works**: Clusters vectors (via k-means), and only searches relevant clusters during retrieval.

⚙️ Parameters:
- `nlist`: Number of clusters
- `nprobe`: Clusters to search per query

✅ Use When:
- Dataset from 100K to 10M
- Speed and recall balance needed

```python
quantizer = faiss.IndexFlatL2(dim)
index = faiss.IndexIVFFlat(quantizer, dim, nlist)
index.train(vectors)
index.add(vectors)
```

---

### 3. HNSW (Hierarchical Navigable Small World)

- **How it works**: Graph-based multi-layer index enabling logarithmic search time.

🧠 Concepts:
- Nodes link to nearest neighbors
- Combines search quality with speed

✅ Use When:
- Dataset > 100K
- You need fast and accurate ANN

```python
index = faiss.IndexHNSWFlat(dim, M=32)
index.hnsw.efConstruction = 40
index.add(vectors)
```

---

### 4. PQ (Product Quantization)

- **How it works**: Splits vectors into sub-vectors and quantizes each part, reducing memory.

✅ Use When:
- Dataset is massive
- Memory optimization is critical

```python
index = faiss.IndexIVFPQ(quantizer, dim, nlist, m=8, nbits=8)
index.train(vectors)
index.add(vectors)
```

---

### 5. Annoy (Spotify)

- Uses random projection trees
- Great for static, read-heavy datasets
- Fast but less accurate

---

### 6. ScaNN, DiskANN, NGT (Advanced ANN)

| Technique | Creator       | Use Case                          |
|-----------|---------------|-----------------------------------|
| ScaNN     | Google        | High-speed on TPUs                |
| DiskANN   | Microsoft     | Disk-based, memory-efficient ANN  |
| NGT       | Yahoo Japan   | Fast graph traversal              |

## 💡 Tip

- **FAISS** lets you manually select and tune these techniques.
- **Pinecone** abstracts the indexing layer.
- **Weaviate** uses HNSW by default and adds metadata + semantic search.
