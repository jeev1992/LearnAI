# Prompting Techniques with Technical Examples (Zero-shot, Few-shot, Fewer-shot)

Vector Language Models (LLMs) can be guided using different prompting techniques. Here we explain **Zero-shot, Few-shot, and Fewer-shot prompting** with technical examples, especially for **JSON generation and structured data extraction**.

---

## 1. Zero-shot Prompting

**Scenario:** Generate JSON from plain text **without providing examples**.

**Task:** Convert a text description of a person into JSON.

**Prompt (Zero-shot):**

```
Convert the following text into a JSON object with fields: name, age, and profession.

Text: "Alice is a 28-year-old software engineer living in San Francisco."
```

**Expected Model Output:**

```json
{
  "name": "Alice",
  "age": 28,
  "profession": "software engineer"
}
```

**Pros:**

* Works out-of-the-box.
* No need to prepare examples.

**Cons:**

* Can fail if the text is complex or ambiguous.

**Use Case:**

* Quick JSON extraction, logs parsing, or metadata generation.

## 2. Few-shot Prompting

**Scenario:** Provide **multiple examples** so the model can learn **structure and format**.

**Prompt (Few-shot):**

```
Convert the following texts into JSON objects.

Example 1:
Text: "Bob is a 35-year-old data scientist living in New York."
JSON:
{
  "name": "Bob",
  "age": 35,
  "profession": "data scientist"
}

Example 2:
Text: "Clara is a 42-year-old UX designer from London."
JSON:
{
  "name": "Clara",
  "age": 42,
  "profession": "UX designer"
}

Now convert this:
Text: "David is a 30-year-old product manager living in Berlin."
JSON:
```

**Expected Model Output:**

```json
{
  "name": "David",
  "age": 30,
  "profession": "product manager"
}
```

**Pros:**

* Model understands **JSON format**, field names, and capitalization.
* Reduces errors in structured outputs.

**Cons:**

* Token usage increases with each example.

**Use Case:**

* Data extraction pipelines, API request generation, structured logging.

## 3. Fewer-shot Prompting

**Scenario:** Provide **just one example** to nudge the model.

**Prompt (Fewer-shot):**

```
Convert the following text into JSON. Follow the format in the example.

Example:
Text: "Emily is a 27-year-old graphic designer from Tokyo."
JSON:
{
  "name": "Emily",
  "age": 27,
  "profession": "graphic designer"
}

Text: "Frank is a 33-year-old DevOps engineer living in Sydney."
JSON:
```

**Expected Model Output:**

```json
{
  "name": "Frank",
  "age": 33,
  "profession": "DevOps engineer"
}
```

**Pros:**

* Efficient, low token usage.
* Still guides model formatting.

**Cons:**

* May fail on unusual or very complex inputs.

**Use Case:**

* Lightweight structured data extraction for real-time APIs.

| Task                       | Zero-shot                                  | Few-shot                                                                 | Fewer-shot                  |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------- |
| JSON Extraction            | Convert text → JSON directly               | Provide 2–3 JSON examples before new input                               | Provide 1 JSON example      |
| Regex-like Extraction      | Ask: “Extract email from text”             | Show examples: `"My email is x@example.com" → {"email":"x@example.com"}` | Show 1 example              |
| SQL Generation             | “Generate SQL to count users from a table” | Show examples of SELECT queries                                          | Show 1 query example        |
| HTML / Markdown Generation | “Convert text to HTML”                     | Provide a few text→HTML mappings                                         | Provide 1 text→HTML mapping |

| Few-shot   | Multiple examples | High        | High                          | Generate JSON or SQL with proper formatting                |
| Fewer-shot | 1–2 examples      | Medium      | Moderate-High                 | Generate JSON, HTML, or API requests with minimal guidance |

✅ **Key Insight:**

* **Zero-shot:** relies on the model’s knowledge.
* **Few-shot:** teaches the model a **pattern explicitly**.
* **Fewer-shot:** gives a **small nudge**, sufficient for simple structured tasks.
