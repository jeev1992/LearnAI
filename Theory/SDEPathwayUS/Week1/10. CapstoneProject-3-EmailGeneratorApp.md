# 📧 Email Generator App – Problem, Solutions, and UI Approaches

## 1. Problem Definition
The **Email Generator App** leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to automatically generate professional and contextually accurate email drafts.  
It streamlines email communication by providing quick, reliable drafts based on prompts or context.  

### Objectives
- Generate coherent and contextually appropriate email drafts.  
- Support customization and personalization.  
- Ensure accuracy and relevancy.  
- Provide a user-friendly interface for seamless email management.  

### Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: React / Streamlit  
- **Backend**: Node.js / Flask / Django  
- **Database**: MongoDB  
- **NLP Model**: GPT-4 or similar LLM  
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions  
- **Deployment**: Docker, AWS  

### Milestones
- **Week 1**: Scope, setup, dataset preparation  
- **Week 2**: Backend APIs + LLM integration  
- **Week 3**: Frontend development + integration  
- **Week 4**: Testing, deployment, documentation  

### Deliverables
- Functional email generator app  
- Backend APIs for generation & customization  
- User-friendly interface for managing drafts  
- Comprehensive documentation & guides  
- Deployed cloud-based application

## 2. UI Approaches

### Option 1 – **Chat-style UI**
- Looks like a chatbot.  
- Users type instructions in **natural language** (e.g., “Make this shorter and friendlier”).  
- LLM infers **recipient, tone, style, length, purpose** from conversation.  
- Conversation history = version control.  

### Option 2 – **Form-style UI**
- Users fill structured inputs: Recipient, Purpose, Tone, Length.  
- Draft shown in editor box.  
- Rewrite section has **dropdowns/checkboxes** for tone, length, style tweaks.  
- Rewrites appear side-by-side for comparison.  
- Version control = explicit side-by-side display.  

---

## 3. Rewrite Feature

### In Form-style UI (Option 2)
- Dropdowns for **Tone**, **Length**.  
- Checkboxes for **Style tweaks**.  
- [🔄 Rewrite Draft] button generates new version.  
- Versions shown **side-by-side** with options:  
  - [✅ Use this]  
  - [🔄 Rewrite again]  
  - [⏪ Revert]  

### In Chat-style UI (Option 1 / Natural Language)
- Users just **say what they want**:  
  - “Make this shorter and more casual.”  
  - “Turn body into 3 bullet points.”  
- LLM interprets request and generates rewritten draft.  
- Versions tracked in **chat history**.  

---

## 4. Prompt Patterns

### Initial Draft Prompts
- “Write a professional email to my engineering manager Priya summarizing today’s design doc discussion.”  
- “Draft a short, friendly thank-you email to a recruiter.”  
- “Generate a persuasive client update email about project delays.”  

### Rewrite Prompts
- “Make this friendlier and shorter.”  
- “Rewrite as if I’m writing to a senior executive.”  
- “Turn this into 3 bullet points.”  
- “Make it casual, like I’m writing to a teammate.”  

### Refinement Prompts
- “Combine version 1 and version 3 into a final draft.”  
- “Keep the tone of version 2 but add details from version 4.”  
- “Make the closing line warmer.”  

### Finalization Prompts
- “Save this as my final draft.”  
- “Export to clipboard.”  
- “Send to Gmail as draft.”

## 5. System Prompt Template (Backend)

```text
SYSTEM PROMPT:
You are an AI Email Assistant. 
Your job is to generate, rewrite, and refine email drafts based on the user’s natural language instructions. 
Always produce coherent, professional, and contextually accurate drafts. 
Infer recipient, purpose, tone, and length from the user’s request. 
Show only the email content unless the user asks for explanation. 
```

# 📌 Scope of the Email Generator App

## 1. Core MVP Features
The following components must be built to deliver a functional Minimum Viable Product:

### 1.1 Frontend
- **Email Draft Interface**  
  - Input area for natural language instructions or structured prompts (depending on UI style).  
  - Editable draft editor to view and modify generated emails.  
  - Versioning panel to compare previous drafts (form-style) or chat history (chat-style).  

- **Rewrite / Refinement Controls**  
  - Option to rewrite drafts using tone, length, style instructions (dropdowns in form-style, plain text commands in chat-style).  
  - Buttons for regenerating or finalizing drafts.  

- **Draft Management**  
  - Save drafts to user account.  
  - Load previously saved drafts.  
  - Export drafts to clipboard or email client (optional initial integration).  

- **User Authentication (Optional MVP)**  
  - Sign-up / login (email/password or OAuth).  
  - Profile storing user preferences like default tone or signature.  

---

### 1.2 Backend
- **REST API / GraphQL** to handle:  
  - Draft generation (`POST /generate`)  
  - Draft rewriting (`POST /rewrite`)  
  - Draft retrieval, updating, deletion (`GET /drafts`, `PATCH /drafts/:id`, `DELETE /drafts/:id`)  
  - Template management (`GET /templates`, `POST /templates`)  

- **LLM Integration**  
  - Interface with GPT-4 or equivalent to generate, rewrite, and refine drafts.  
  - Implement prompt handling and variable injection (recipient, tone, purpose, length).  

- **Version Control / History**  
  - Track multiple versions of drafts for each email.  
  - Store metadata: tone, length, style changes, timestamps, user edits.  

---

### 1.3 Database
- **Drafts Collection**  
  - Fields: user ID, subject, body, metadata (tone, length, style, model), version history.  

- **User Collection**  
  - Fields: name, email, signature, default preferences.  

- **Optional Templates Collection**  
  - Pre-built email templates for common use cases (follow-up, thank you, cold email, etc.).  

---

### 1.4 LLM Prompts
- **Prompt templates** for:  
  - Initial draft generation  
  - Rewrite / refinement  
  - Context-aware versioning  
  - Finalization / export  

- **Backend handling** for dynamic variable insertion (recipient, purpose, tone, length, style tweaks).  

---

### 1.5 Deployment & DevOps
- **Containerization** using Docker.  
- **Cloud Deployment** on AWS (ECS, Fargate, or Elastic Beanstalk).  
- **CI/CD Pipeline** with GitHub Actions for linting, testing, build, and deployment.  
- **Monitoring & Logging**: track errors, API usage, latency, token usage.  

---

## 2. Optional / Phase 2 Enhancements
- **Full Natural Language Chat UI** (no forms; LLM extracts all context).  
- **Multi-language support**.  
- **Integration with Gmail, Outlook, or other email clients** for direct sending.  
- **Team / organization features** (shared templates, draft approvals).  
- **Personalization learning** (system learns user style from edits).  
- **Advanced formatting options** (bullet points, tables, rich text).  

---

## 3. Out of Scope (MVP)
- Sending emails directly via SMTP or Gmail API (Phase 2).  
- Complex analytics on email effectiveness.  
- AI evaluation of email impact or engagement.  
- On-premise LLM hosting (optional enterprise feature).  

---

✅ **Summary:**  
The MVP focuses on:  
1. **Draft generation** using LLMs.  
2. **Editable UI** for viewing, rewriting, and managing drafts.  
3. **Backend API + database** for storing and versioning drafts.  
4. **Deployment pipeline** for cloud hosting.  

Future phases can add **direct integrations, advanced personalization, chat UI, and enterprise features**.
