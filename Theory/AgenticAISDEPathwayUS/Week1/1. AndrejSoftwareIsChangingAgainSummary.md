# Lecture Script: Software in the Era of AI
*Based on Andrej Karpathy’s talk*

---

## Introduction (2 minutes)

Hello everyone!  

Today, I am going to talk about **Andrej Karpathy’s talk “Software in the Era of AI.”**  
Andrej Karpathy was the Director of AI at Tesla and has worked on cutting-edge AI systems, including Tesla Autopilot.  

In this talk, Karpathy explains **how software is changing rapidly in the era of AI**. The main idea is that software today is not just code. We are now programming **neural networks and large language models (LLMs)**, which is a completely new paradigm compared to traditional software.  

You can think of this as a major shift, just like when computers replaced typewriters.

## The Evolution of Software: 1.0, 2.0, 3.0 (4 minutes)

Karpathy divides software into three phases:

### 1. Software 1.0
Traditional code written by humans. Explicit instructions for the computer.  
*Example:* Writing a calculator in Python – we define exactly how to add, subtract, multiply, or divide numbers.  

### 2. Software 2.0
Software is trained using data. Humans design the dataset and model architecture. Neural networks learn the parameters automatically.  
*Example:* Tesla Autopilot uses neural networks to process camera inputs and decide actions.  

*Analogy:*  
- 1.0 = writing a recipe step by step.  
- 2.0 = training a chef by showing thousands of dishes.  
- 3.0 = telling a chef in English, “Make something spicy with chicken and rice.”

### 3. Software 3.0
Large language models allow **programming in natural language**.  
*Example:* Instead of writing Python to classify text, you prompt an LLM: “Classify this review as positive or negative.”  

**Key takeaway:** Modern software combines **code, data, and natural language prompts**.

## LLMs as Utilities and Operating Systems (3 minutes)

- **Utility analogy:** LLMs are like electricity. Labs build them; users consume them.  

- **Operating system analogy:**  
  - Model = CPU  
  - Context window = memory  
  - Prompts = instructions  

*Example:* Using ChatGPT to write code is like interacting with a new OS.  

*Fun analogy:* If LLMs go down, it’s like an **intelligence brownout**.

## Understanding LLM Psychology (3 minutes)

- **Superhuman capabilities:** LLMs remember/process massive information.  
  *Example:* Memorizing thousands of facts.  

- **Cognitive deficits:** LLMs hallucinate or make mistakes.  
  *Example:* Saying “9.11 > 9.9.”  

- **Anterograde amnesia:** Forget past interactions unless context is provided.  

- **Security limitations:** Susceptible to prompt injections or leaks.  

**Takeaway:** LLMs are **powerful but fallible**.

## Partial Autonomy Applications (4 minutes)

- Humans verify, AI generates.  
- *Example:* Cursor – an AI coding assistant:  
  - Multiple models for embeddings, diffs, code generation  
  - Autonomy slider lets humans control AI power  

*Analogy:* Tesla Autopilot – partially autonomous, humans in the loop.  

**Best practices:**  
1. Small incremental steps  
2. Keep AI on a “leash”  
3. Use precise prompts

## Everyone is a Programmer (2 minutes)

- Software 3.0 allows **anyone to program using natural language**.  
- *Example:* Karpathy built an iOS app in a day using AI without Swift knowledge.  

*Analogy:* Previously, programming = driving manual car. Now = self-driving car; just give directions.

## Building for Agents (2 minutes)

- Agents = AI entities interacting with software infrastructure.  
- Documentation can be **agent-friendly**: `llm.txt` similar to `robots.txt`.  
- Companies like Vercel and Stripe write Markdown docs for AI.  

---

## Human-AI Cooperation (2 minutes)

- Humans verify, AI generates.  
- GUI improves verification.  
- Autonomy slider: AI assists but humans remain in control.  

*Analogy:* Iron Man suit – partly autonomous, partly human-controlled.

## Summary and Key Takeaways (2 minutes)

1. Software evolution:  
   - 1.0 = code  
   - 2.0 = neural networks  
   - 3.0 = LLM prompts  

2. LLMs = new operating systems: powerful but fallible.  
3. Partial autonomy apps = humans + AI collaboration.  
4. Natural language programming makes **everyone a programmer**.  
5. Era of AI = unprecedented opportunities for developers.

## Closing (1 minute)

- We are in a **new era of software** with AI at the core.  
- Understanding LLMs, limitations, and human-AI cooperation is critical.  
- Karpathy reminds us: **software is evolving, and this is our chance to shape the future.**
